Iconic Snake
Iconic Snake is a classic snake game developed by Kunwar Pal as a mini project using C++ programming language. The game is played on a single screen with retro-style graphics and sound effects.

How to Play
The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat as much food as possible without crashing into the walls. The snake grows longer with each food item consumed, making it more challenging to navigate the grid. The rule of the game is that the snake will die and the game will end if it crashes into a wall.

To control the snake, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move it in the desired direction. The speed of the snake will increase automatically as it eats more food, making the game progressively more difficult.

Installation
To play Iconic Snake, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kunwarpal621311/iconic-snake.git
Compile the game using your  turbo C++ compiler, and run the executable file to start playing.

Credits
Iconic Snake was developed by Kunwar Pal as a mini project for Mangalmay College. The game is inspired by classic snake games, and Kunwar Pal used C++ programming language and the simple graphics library to create the game.
