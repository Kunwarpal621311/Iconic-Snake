# Iconic-Snake
The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat as much food as possible without crashing into the walls. The snake grows longer with each food item consumed, making it more challenging to navigate the grid. The rule of the game is that the snake will die and the game will end if it crashes into a wall.
